hist(adelie_penguins$flipper_length_mm)

#The resulting histogram shows that the distribution of flipper length for Ad√©lie penguins is approximately normal. This is supported by the following evidence:

#The histogram is symmetrical, with a peak in the middle.
#The distribution is unimodal, meaning that there is only one peak.
#The distribution is mesokurtic, meaning that the kurtosis of the distribution is close to the normal distribution.
```

<B> Question 29: </B>
</P>
```{r Q29, include = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
gentoo_penguins <- penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo")

ggplot(data = gentoo_penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm))+geom_point()

#The resulting scatter plot shows that there is a positive correlation between flipper length and beak depth in gentoo penguins. This means that as flipper length increases, beak depth also tends to increase.

#Gentoo penguins use their flippers for swimming and hunting. A longer flipper length allows a penguin to swim faster and more efficiently. It also allows a penguin to reach deeper into the water to catch prey. A deeper beak depth is also beneficial for catching prey, as it allows a penguin to grip and tear food more effectively.
```


<P> 
<B> Question 30(Executive Summary): </B>

The above 2 questions explore the distribution of flipper length in Adelie penguins and the relationship between flipper length and beak depth in gentoo penguins.

The length of Adelie penguin flippers is normally distributed, meaning that most penguins have flippers of medium length, and fewer penguins have very short or very long flippers. This is supported by the shape of the histogram of flipper lengths, which is symmetrical and has a single peak.

Gentoo penguins with longer flippers also have deeper beaks. This is because both flipper length and beak depth are helpful for swimming and catching food.

Overall, the results of this report suggest that flipper length is an important morphological feature for penguins. A longer flipper length allows penguins to swim faster and more efficiently, and to reach deeper into the water to catch prey.

<B>Conclusion: </B>
</FONT>
<P>
To conclude from this project,I have learnt probability distributions using functions like dnorm,pnorm,qnorm and rnorm.Also,I have plotted a histogram of sample mean(in hours) vs frequency.Also applied measures of central tendency and dispersion,ie, mean and variance.
